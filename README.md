## Informatic 1 in HEVS - Practice - RÃ©mi Heredero

All my work for labo during the second semester in engineering school of Wallis for Industrial Systems.

All the practical exercices come to the module INF1 in HES-SO Valais/Wallis.

It's only some small labo on java. Probably nothing interesting, but maybe it can help someone one day. I store by labs in src for have only one Java project for all those labs.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
